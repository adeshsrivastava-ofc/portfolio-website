# Warp AI Portfolio Build Conversation Backup

This file is intended to persist the full Warp AI session for the portfolio website at `mrshady.dev`.

> IMPORTANT: For full fidelity, copy the entire conversation (all user prompts, AI responses, and relevant terminal output) from the Warp AI panel and terminal history into this file under **Conversation Transcript**. The AI agent cannot programmatically read and dump the full chat log, so manual copy-paste from Warp is required to avoid omissions or inaccuracies.
